## Overview
EarScanner3D is a medical application developed in 2021 in collaboration with QUT's Biofabrication and Tissue Morphology Group to assist individuals with microtia. The application leverages existing technology, providing a frugal and accessible framework for capturing the external ear using smartphone-based 3D scanning. This approach addresses the high costs and invasiveness associated with traditional impression techniques and high-end 3D scanning solutions.

## Purpose
The aim of this project is to provide an affordable, non-invasive solution for capturing anatomical details of the external ear to create personalized prosthetics. This method democratizes access to 3D scanning technology, particularly for individuals requiring craniofacial prosthetics, by utilizing widely available smartphones and photogrammetry techniques.

## Features
- **Accessible and Easy to Use**: Designed for novice operators who can quickly learn and apply the methodology after watching an instructional video.
- **Clinical Translation**: Potential applications include clinical assessment, personalized device manufacturing, and ear prostheses creation.

## Technology and Methodology
This application is built around photogrammetry techniques that process multiple images captured by a smartphone camera to send to dropbox where individuals can then generate a 3D model. EarScanner3D is developed using Swift, ensuring seamless integration with iOS devices. By using consumer-grade hardware and software, EarScanner3D significantly reduces the costs and complexity associated with traditional 3D scanning solutions.
